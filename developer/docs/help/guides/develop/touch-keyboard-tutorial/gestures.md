title: Using Gestures in Keyman Developer
---

Keyman Developer offers **Longpress** keys, **Flicks**, and **Multitaps** for touch keyboard layout. To allow gestures onto your keyboard, go to the Touch layout tab and define the keys as followed:

## Tips

* We can use both **flicks** and **long presses** in a single keyboard. Generally, we recommend only having flicks in one direction--south (down), and long presses work well with this pattern. See, for example, [sil_euro_latin](../../../../keyboard/sil_euro_latin/3.0.3/sil_euro_latin#toc-mobile-keyboard-layout). 
    * Youâ€™ll also notice on sil_euro_latin that the south-flicks on the base (and shift) layers correspond to the numeric/symbol layer, which is also helpful for remembering and discovering.
* **Flicks** in multiple directions are possible, but currently Keyman does not support hints for multiple directions, so they are not very discoverable.
* **Long presses** are more discoverable, but **flicks** are faster. We suggest using south flicks along with long presses, and including the flick output in the long press for maximum discoverability and optimum ergonomics.

## Caution

* **Flicks** near screen edges tend to be problematic--once you drag off the screen, then Keyman can no longer tell that you are flicking (or you may end up activating system controls on the bottom edge):
  * On the bottom row, south flicks are not recommended.
  * On the top row, we have the banner space reserved in order to be able to support flicks and long presses up into that region of the screen--not an ideal solution, but it works.
  * Left/right screen edges, horizontal flicks are not the best practice.
